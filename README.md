🏠 House Price Prediction System – End-to-End ML + MLOps

This project is a production-grade House Price Prediction System built using Machine Learning, MLOps, and software engineering design patterns. Inspired by enterprise-level workflows, it covers everything from data ingestion, EDA, feature engineering, and model training, to CI/CD, pipeline orchestration, and experiment tracking.

🚀 Project Overview

Unlike typical Kaggle notebooks, this system is designed to help you stand out in the top 1% of ML engineers by combining:

Core ML techniques

Strong coding architecture

Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Template)

Production-ready MLOps

The model predicts house prices based on multiple features while ensuring robustness, reproducibility, and scalability.

✨ Key Features

Advanced Data Ingestion System

Factory Pattern to handle multiple data formats (ZIP, CSV, JSON, etc.)

Automated validation & error handling

Deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Strategy Pattern for switching inspection methods

Missing value heatmaps, distribution plots, multivariate analysis

Feature Engineering & Model Development

Outlier detection

Handling skewness

Encoding categorical variables

Algorithm assumptions checks

MLOps Integration

ZenML pipelines for orchestration

MLflow for experiment tracking & deployment

CI/CD for automated testing & production deployment

Clean & Scalable Codebase

Template Pattern-based workflows

Well-documented modules and reusable components

🛠 Tech Stack

Core ML: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
MLOps: ZenML, MLflow
Architecture: Factory Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Template Pattern
Tools: VS Code / Jupyter, Git, CI/CD
